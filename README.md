## 🎅🏻🤶🏻 Santa Tracker

The current project aims to be a version of the most recent Santa tracker I created using shell.  In this particular case we will have a full blown app and a backend for performing operations.

Something that I learned as I worked on the last Santa tool is that things can change as I go and that change is for the better.  Hence I will not worry as much for things like names or even the overall app as I expect that ideas will start flowing, pushing me to change things for the better.
